Welcome to the "Multi-Class Prediction of Cirrhosis Outcomes" project! This repository contains the code and resources used by Luficer G to achieve an impressive rank of 39 out of 1700 participants in a Kaggle competition. The main file, `it-s-me-luficer-g.ipynb`, showcases the techniques and methodologies employed to accomplish this feat.

#### About the Project

Cirrhosis is a severe liver disease that can have various outcomes based on factors such as patient demographics, medical history, and laboratory test results. This project focuses on predicting these outcomes using machine learning techniques. By analyzing a comprehensive dataset, we were able to develop a robust predictive model that achieved high accuracy and performance.

#### Highlights

- **Impressive Achievement**: Ranked `39 out of 1700` participants in a Kaggle competition.
- **Learning Opportunity**: Explore the code and techniques used to develop a successful predictive model.
- **Python Codebase**: The project is implemented using Python programming language.
- **XGBOOST & Many BOOSTING ALGO**: This project has XGBOOST algorithm to finally predict, but I have also trained many algorithms also here.. so check it out
- **Optuna** : This is framework to fine tune the model ..check out [here](https://optuna.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorial/index.html)

#### Usage
