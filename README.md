# Kaggle Competition Notebooks by Lucifer G

Welcome to my repository of Kaggle competition notebooks! ðŸš€ As a Kaggle notebook master,
I love diving into various competitions and exploring innovative solutions to challenging problems. 
Here, you'll find a collection of notebooks from competitions I've participated in, along with the associated data.

## About Me
I'm Lucifer, a data enthusiast passionate about machine learning and data science. 
My journey on Kaggle has been incredibly rewarding, allowing me to learn, grow, and connect with like-minded individuals from around the world.

## Competitions
Below is a list of competitions I've participated in and notebooks I've created:

### 1. [Cirrhosis Outcomes](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s3e26/)
- **Description:** The dataset for this competition (both train and test) was generated from a deep learning model trained on the Cirrhosis Patient Survival Prediction dataset.Feature distributions are close to, but not exactly the same, as the original.Feel free to use the original dataset as part of this competition, both to explore differences as well as to see whether incorporating the original in training improves model performance.

### 2. [A Bank Churn](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s4e1/)
- **Description:** The dataset for this competition (both train and test) was generated from a deep learning model trained on the Bank Customer Churn Prediction dataset. Feature distributions are close to, but not exactly the same, as the original. Feel free to use the original dataset as part of this competition, both to explore differences as well as to see whether incorporating the original in training improves model performance.

### 3. [OBESITY Prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s4e2/)
- **Description:** The dataset for this competition (both train and test) was generated from a deep learning model trained on the Obesity or CVD risk dataset. Feature distributions are close to, but not exactly the same, as the original. Feel free to use the original dataset as part of this competition, both to explore differences as well as to see whether incorporating the original in training improves model performance.
